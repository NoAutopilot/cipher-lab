check-solved (26 Sept 2026, bRIK, LANE B5): grepped a fresh shallow clone of dbourdeau/cyphersolver
(commit fc0c9e865d0fae67ca92d19750d2b09ab11972e0, 2026-09-25 -- riksarkivet1628/NOTES.md read in full:
"outcome (21 Sept 2026): read in part... R4282, R4284 and R4306 were attempted and stay open"; the
R4284 key-test leaf is explicitly logged there as "not yet used" against R4282); grepped a fresh
shallow clone of aaymeloglu/unsolved-ciphers (both catalogue/decode-records.jsonl and
decode-catalog.csv give id 4282 and id 4284 both `Non-decrypted`, no further note; clone deleted
after grep); DECODE's own login-free listing cache already on disk (sources/decode/records-non-decrypted-2026-09-24.tsv,
fetched 24 Sept 2026, read this session, not re-fetched) lists 4282 and 4284 both `Non-decrypted`,

## What this is

Riksarkivet Stockholm, Chifferklaver låda II:113 (DECODE record 4282) and låda II:114 (DECODE record
4284), 1628 (QUEUE.md G4 / "Re-rank for LANE B5" rank 4). Both Latin letters in the same "unknown
sender/recipient, Stockholm, Latin, 1628-1646" catalogue bundle (DECODE catalogue #207) that Bourdeau's
own NOTES.md (`riksarkivet1628/`) shows is really four unrelated correspondences -- the R4282/R4284
key-sharing tested here is a hypothesis from that bundling, not an established fact (QUEUE.md's own
caveat on this row).

- R4282: a ~1,000-character Latin letter cipher using Latin letter shapes plus a handful of special
  signs (D, L=lambda, T=delta, B=boxed square, E=epsilon, F=phi, A=alpha, M=mu, G) and digits 3 4 5 7 8,
  with a few words left in clear Latin. Not read (Bourdeau: "homophonic and substitution annealing...
  gave no Latin").
- R4284: a numeric homophonic cipher (108 distinct values over ~754 numbers), also not read, but
  carries on one leaf a **key-test**: four Latin phrases ("effusorem sanguinis", "pestem patriae",
  "praeter naturalem", "disturbatorem religionis") written by a period hand directly over their
  cipher-letter equivalents -- a different, letter-shaped alphabet from R4284's own numeric body,
  which Bourdeau's notes flag as possibly R4282's own alphabet, never tried against it.

Image over transcription (rule 2): only Bourdeau's single-pass eye transcriptions of both leaves exist
here (`r4282_transcription_bourdeau.txt`, `r4284_transcription_bourdeau.txt`, copied verbatim from
dbourdeau/cyphersolver, riksarkivet1628/, commit fc0c9e8, read 26 Sept 2026, credited per CLAUDE.md
item 8 -- MIT code, CC BY 4.0 text). No page image was fetched this job (disk/git-only cap; DECODE's
full-size images are account-blocked without a working login, and Riksarkivet's own IIIF route was not
needed since Bourdeau's transcription already existed). Any negative below is conditional on that
transcription being accurate; Bourdeau's own comment on the key-test leaf notes "individual letters
uncertain, esp. g/y/p/z", and two of the four crib words come up 1-2 characters longer or shorter on
the cipher side than the Latin phrase they gloss (see `report.json`'s `crib_mismatches`), consistent
with that uncertainty.

## Test run (26 Sept 2026, bRIK): R4284 key-test leaf as a crib against R4282

Method: `scripts/crib_test.py` (reproducible, `--check` re-derives and diffs; rule 7). It parses the
four (Latin phrase, cipher word) pairs from the key-test leaf, aligns them character-by-character
(truncating the two mismatched-length pairs at the shorter side, logged in `report.json`), builds a
letter -> cipher-sign(s) key (homophonic: e.g. `s` has four signs, `e` three, `t` one), and applies the
reverse (sign -> majority letter) to every non-bracketed cipher sign in R4282.

Design (rule 3, three conditions, one gate question: does the crib's *specific* letter assignment do
anything on R4282, beyond what its symbol alphabet alone would by chance):
- **A** (the test): real crib key vs real R4282.
- **B0-B2** (control 1): three synthetic keys of the same shape -- the same sign groupings the crib
  actually found (which signs are homophones of which other signs), but with the 16 letter labels
  reshuffled across those groups -- vs real R4282. Isolates whether the crib's own letter choices, not
  just its alphabet, matter.
- **C0-C2** (control 2): the real crib key vs three random shuffles of R4282's own cipher-character
  stream (multiset preserved, order destroyed). Isolates whether any Latin-like structure the crib
  surfaces depends on R4282's actual character order.

No wired Latin corpus exists for `tools/judge_plaintext.py` (`LANG_CORPORA` has no `"la"` key; the
tool's own comment calls `tools/data/la_repo` circular -- its one file is a target's own reading, not
an independent corpus -- "not wired"). Latin-likeness is graded by eye (rule 4: M grade) using a small
fixed list of common short Latin function words/endings (`et in ad ut sit est non sed per cum qui quod
de ab ex si se nec jam tam tum hoc hic haec ille eius suis quae quibus atque que tur unt ent ibus orum
arum tio tas`) as a substring-match count over decoded tokens, applied identically to A, B and C so it
is at least a fair comparison even though it is not a language model.

### Numbers (from `report.json`; German not run -- letter is Latin, not the 1628-33 German-era R4330/31
crib, so `de16`/`de` was not the applicable judge here; H0 count 0, C0, S0, all M/I)

| condition | coverage (chars) | coverage frac | Latin-hint tokens (of 155) | fully-covered tokens >=3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A: real crib key vs real R4282 | 471/1094 | 0.4305 | 4 | 2 |
| B0: synthetic key (same shape) vs real R4282 | 471/1094 | 0.4305 | 8 | 2 |
| B1: synthetic key (same shape) vs real R4282 | 471/1094 | 0.4305 | 3 | 2 |
| B2: synthetic key (same shape) vs real R4282 | 471/1094 | 0.4305 | 8 | 2 |
| C0: real crib key vs shuffled R4282 | 471/1094 | 0.4305 | 1 | 3 |
| C1: real crib key vs shuffled R4282 | 471/1094 | 0.4305 | 2 | 4 |
| C2: real crib key vs shuffled R4282 | 471/1094 | 0.4305 | 1 | 5 |

Coverage (43.05%) is identical across every row by construction (A/B share the same known-sign set;
C preserves the character multiset) -- reported per rule 3 ("report both numbers"), not because it
distinguishes anything here. The number that would distinguish a real hit is the Latin-hint count:
real crib (A=4) sits inside, and below the mean of, the same-shape synthetic-key range (B: 3, 4, 8;
mean 5.0) and does not exceed the shuffled-R4282 range either (C: 1, 1, 2). By the fixed by-eye metric
used identically across all seven runs, R4284's key-test leaf, applied as a crib, does not make R4282
read more like Latin than a same-shape key with the letters reshuffled.

### Reading the decoded sample (grade M, by eye, sighted on `report.json`'s `sample_decoded` for A)

`_t_n m__save _sp___r _es_ft fv____ n____ n_p_r__pm ___p__e ____ _f__eaf_a__ vpf__v_e_ ...` -- no
run of more than 3-4 consecutive covered signs forms a recognisable Latin word or ending under the
fixed hint list beyond scattered 2-3-letter fragments ("save", "est" inside "_es_ft", "eaf" -- none of
which are the phrases used to build the key, so not circular, but also none is a clear content word).
Same impression on the B and C samples in `report.json` (not reproduced here for length).

### Verdict

**Partial, not closed-negative** (rule 5 as amended, CLAUDE.md LANE B3 line): this is a control-backed
negative for the specific hypothesis under test (R4284's key-test leaf, read as a direct letter-cipher
key, unlocks R4282), not a exhaustive negative for "R4282 and R4284 share a key" in general --
untested: (a) the key-test leaf might use a *different* sign-to-letter direction, i.e. plaintext read
top-to-bottom rather than left-to-right through the multi-line cipher block (Bourdeau's transcription
keeps the two-line phrase/cipher pairing but this job did not re-check the leaf image itself for a
column-wise reading); (b) the two length-mismatched pairs (`natvralem`/`cpikyppatb`,
`religionis`/`gtaygygdieys`) were truncated rather than re-aligned by eye against the image, which this
job's disk-only cap did not allow; (c) R4282's own special signs (L=lambda, T=delta, B, E, F, A, M, D,
G) were never assigned a letter by the crib at all (the leaf's cipher alphabet is plain Latin letters
plus one capital L and one digit 3), so 57% of R4282's characters are outside this crib's reach
regardless of alignment. A next worker with image access could re-transcribe the key-test leaf leaf
against the actual photograph to settle (a) and (b), and check whether R4282's special signs appear
anywhere else in the R4284 leaf or body that this pass did not have time to search.

No language-judge PASS/FAIL is claimed (no wired "la" corpus; see above). Files: `r4282_transcription_bourdeau.txt`,
`r4284_transcription_bourdeau.txt` (both credited copies from Bourdeau, dbourdeau/cyphersolver,
riksarkivet1628/, commit fc0c9e8, read 26 Sept 2026), `scripts/crib_test.py`, `report.json`.
