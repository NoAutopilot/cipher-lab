# decode-1411-hhsta-vienna-1600

Status: open

## What this is

DECODE R1411: Vienna, Österreichisches Staatsarchiv, HHStA, Staatskanzlei Interiora, Chiffrenschlüssel, Kt. 14,
Fasc. 20, f.182-192, 1600-1799, German cleartext/plaintext, Partially decrypted, 18 pages, at least 12 images
seen (free login). QUEUE.md row DC2 flagged an open question the brief repeats: establish first whether this
is a key record or a ciphertext record. Checked as part of LANE N check-solved batch DC1
(`.claude/briefs/runs/2026-09-24-lane-n-csDC1.md`).

## Check-solved sweep, 24 September 2026

1. **Record type.** `sources/decode/records-non-decrypted-2026-09-24-diff.tsv` and aaymeloglu/unsolved-ciphers's
   `catalogue/decode-catalog.csv` both give `record_type: Cipher` for id 1411 (not `Key`) — this answers the
   brief's open question: it is a ciphertext record, cryptanalysis kind, as QUEUE.md's DC2 row already had it.
2. **Aymeloglu.** `unsolved-ciphers/catalogue/decode-ranked.md` row: "| 5 | [1411](.../RecordsView/1411) | 1600
   | Österreichisches Staatsarchiv ... | | German | 18 | inline cleartext; 180 keys from the same collection
   within 20 years |". This id is absent from that file's "Already carrying a deciphered text in DECODE" list
   (checked directly), so per that scrape no "Deciphered text" document is attached. The neighbouring record
   R1410 (same box/fasc.) scores identically with the same "180 keys" signal — Aymeloglu's count of nearby
   DECODE Key records in the Kt.13-21 series within a 20-year window is large but not narrowed to this specific
   f.182-192 span.
3. **Tomokiyo.** `sources/cryptiana/web/habsburg.htm` describes the HHStA Kt.13/Kt.14 Chiffrenschlüssel
   collection at length (Láng 2020's description, ~500 keys across boxes 13-21) and cites several specific
   Kt.14 folio ranges (f.132-135/136-141 printed templates, f.291-302 Carolus Rym 1570, f.311-313) but none
   fall in this record's f.182-192 range — no match found for this specific folio span.
4. **Web.** WebSearch on Benedek Láng's 2020 HistoCrypt description of the Staatskanzlei key collection
   confirms the collection's general scope (boxes 13-21, ~480 keys in the first six boxes per Láng) but
   returned nothing folio-specific to Kt.14 f.182-192.
5. **Bourdeau.** dbourdeau/cyphersolver's `CATALOGUE.md`/`TARGETS.md`: no entry keys on DECODE id 1411. A
   coincidental hit on the bare number "1411" in `CATALOGUE.md` is a different archive's own shelfmark number
   (Hessisches Staatsarchiv Marburg, HStAM 4 h Nr. 1411, an unrelated Hesse-Kassel/Malsburg target) — checked
   and excluded as a false match, not this record.
6. **DECODE.** A prior LANE N pass this session read R1411's RecordsView page directly (QUEUE.md DC2 row): at
   least 12 images, Partially decrypted status, no attached key/transcription/decryption document found on the
   page itself.

## Verdict

**Open.** Partially decrypted status with 18 pages and no attached document on its own RecordsView page
(checked by a prior worker this session) is consistent with only part of the item having been read elsewhere,
not published. "180 keys from the same collection within 20 years" (Aymeloglu's own signal) is a real lead
worth following before any transcription pass: Láng 2020 is the named specialist description of the whole key
collection and should be read in full (not just searched) before deciding whether it, or another Kt.13-21
folio, names a key for this specific fasc./folio range.

Requests this pass: WebSearch 1, github.com 0 (reused shared clones). No fresh DECODE login this pass. No
promotion, no decoding.

## LANE N audit, 24 September 2026

DocumentsList check (`DocumentsList?showmaster=records&fk_id=1411`): **"No records found"** — no attached
key, transcription or decryption document. RecordsView's own field table: `Available Documents:` (empty),
`Inline Cleartext: Yes`, `Inline Plaintext: No`. Read together, this record's "Partially decrypted" DECODE
status is **not backed by any attached document here** — DECODE's own vocabulary most plausibly reflects that
the source pages carry inline cleartext passages around the cipher (a normal diplomatic-letter structure, not
a partial break of the cipher itself), the same distinction QUEUE.md's DC10 note draws for the Modena/Milano
cluster. Nothing here changes the verdict: still **open**, cryptanalysis, transcription is still the next
step. Status word unchanged.

Census diff regenerated this session (normaliser fix): R1411's `held_by` is now
`ours:decode-1411-hhsta-vienna-1600` (was `none`, folder did not exist when the stale diff was made) — pipeline
catching up, not a new finding.
