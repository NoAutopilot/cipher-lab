item-level sweep).

## Source

BnF, Espagnol 142-144 (Supplément français 1257A-C), `ark:/12148/cc347546`. Single named ciphered instruction,
"Autre instruction chiffrée pour l'abbé de Mercy", dated **6 June 1648**, inside a multi-tome Spanish-affairs
volume; no key stated. Not fetched at gallica.bnf.fr or archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr this pass per the brief;
catalogue text only, no image viewed.

## Check-solved sweep (24 September 2026)

1. **Search engine.** `"abbé de Mercy" 1648 instruction chiffrée Espagnol BnF` and `"abbé de Mercy" 1648
   diplomate Espagne Catalogne instruction` -- **the addressee is not securely identified**. No 1640s French
   abbé named Mercy surfaced in a diplomatic role; the only "de Mercy" figures found are chronologically wrong
   (Florimond Claude de Mercy-Argenteau, 1727-1794; Claude Florimond de Mercy, 1666-1734, a soldier not an
   abbé; a 19th-c. bishop of Luçon). Given the volume is Spanish-affairs and the date falls in the Catalan
   Revolt / Franco-Spanish War period, a search for French agents to Catalonia in 1648 (Magí Sivillà i
   Magoles, an abbot acting for the Generalitat; Abel Servien; Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt) found no match
   either. This is a genuine identification gap, not a checked-and-clear negative -- the addressee's identity
   needs the image or the volume's own finding aid, not a general web search.
2. **Printed correspondence / calendars.** Not run: no correspondent securely identified to search by name.
   The instruction itself, addressed by the French crown to its own agent, would most plausibly appear (if
   printed) in a Recueil des instructions données aux ambassadeurs volume for Spain -- not checked this pass.
3. **Cryptiana.** Local snapshot grepped for "Mercy", "Espagnol 142": no hit.
4. **Cipherbrain.** No dedicated query run; the addressee's uncertain identity makes a targeted Cipherbrain
   search unproductive without first resolving who "l'abbé de Mercy" is.
5. **DECODE.** Aymeloglu's cached `catalogue/decode-catalog.csv` (10,107 rows) grepped for "mercy",
   "espagnol 142", "espagnol 143", "espagnol 144": zero hits for any. This repo's own local harvest also has
   no matching row.
6. **Solver repositories.** Fresh shallow clones of both repos grepped for "Mercy" and "Espagnol 142"/
   "cc347546" exactly. "Mercy" returns many hits in both repos (e.g. `herbault1626/`, `bethune/`, `sega1593/`,
   `windischgraetz1720/`, `matignon1586/`) but every one checked by context is either the common French word
   "merci"/"mercy" (clemency) inside unrelated letter transcriptions, or an unrelated named person (none an
   "abbé de Mercy" or this shelfmark). No hit for the shelfmark or ark in either repo.

## Verdict

**Open, stage 2 verified unsolved (conditional).** Not found in a search engine, Cryptiana, DECODE's cached
catalogue, or either solver repository, searched by shelfmark, ark and the addressee's name on 24 Sept 2026.
Conditional, and lower-confidence than most of this pass's rows: the addressee "abbé de Mercy" could not be
identified as a historical figure this pass (name variant, mistranscription, or an obscure agent are all
possible), which blocks the correspondent-specific legs of the sweep (printed correspondence, calendars). The
image or the volume's own finding-aid context (title, adjacent items) is needed before this row can be swept
further.

## Digitisation check (24 Sept 2026, LANE G2 worker O)

**Digitised: yes, ark `btv1b10035717h`, canvas not yet pinned (no folio labels on the manifest) -- but flag:
the item is in Espagnol 144 (TOME III), not Espagnol 142.** (`gallica all "Espagnol 144"` needed two
tunnel-reset retries, `ws_closed_mid_exchange`, before a clean response -- the same lane-wide flakiness noted
for M24; a third attempt returned HTTP 200 but 97210 records, all irrelevant.) The archivesetmanuscrits finding aid
(`https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc347546`) lists three sub-units, "Espagnol 142 (cote) • TOME
I," "Espagnol 143 (cote) • TOME II," "Espagnol 144 (cote) • TOME III"; `avecDaoGal` ("Consultable sur gallica")
is applied to 143 and 144 but **not** to 142. The finding aid's item list places "Autre instruction chiffrée
pour l'abbé de Mercy. Barneton, 6 juin 1648" at **F. 22-22 v° (item 11)**, whose foliation restarts at F.1
after the TOME III/"Espagnol 144" heading (checked by document-position order: the item's HTML anchor
`d0e2774` falls after the Espagnol 144 heading's `d0e2602`, itself after 143's `d0e597` and 142's `d0e82`) --
so the item is in the digitised TOME III, not the undigitised TOME I this target's folder name names. Ark
found via Gallica SRU field query `dc.source all "Espagnol 144"` (needed after `gallica all "Espagnol 144"`
returned 97210 hits, "144" being too common a substring for the non-field-scoped operator); the single
`dc.source`-scoped hit's `dc:relation` cites `archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc347546/cd0e2602` --
the exact Espagnol 144 component id. `tools/gallica_folio.py btv1b10035717h --folio 22` found 605 canvases,
0 with any folio label -- cannot pin the canvas without an eye-checked `--anchor` pair, out of this brief's
scope. Flag for whoever captures this: retitle/relocate this folder to reflect Espagnol 144, or at minimum
correct the shelfmark in any future capture/read files, before crops are cut. Status stays open (not blocked).

Requests this section: gallica.bnf.fr 3 (1 `gallica all` SRU query, 1 `dc.source all` SRU query, 1
`gallica_folio.py` manifest fetch).
