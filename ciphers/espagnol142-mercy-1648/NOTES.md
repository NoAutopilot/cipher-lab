## Source

BnF, Espagnol 142-144 (Supplément français 1257A-C), `ark:/12148/cc347546`. Single named ciphered instruction,
"Autre instruction chiffrée pour l'abbé de Mercy", dated **6 June 1648**, inside a multi-tome Spanish-affairs
volume; no key stated. Not fetched at gallica.bnf.fr or archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr this pass per the brief;
catalogue text only, no image viewed.

## Check-solved sweep (24 September 2026)

1. **Search engine.** `"abbé de Mercy" 1648 instruction chiffrée Espagnol BnF` and `"abbé de Mercy" 1648
   diplomate Espagne Catalogne instruction` -- **the addressee is not securely identified**. No 1640s French
   abbé named Mercy surfaced in a diplomatic role; the only "de Mercy" figures found are chronologically wrong
   (Florimond Claude de Mercy-Argenteau, 1727-1794; Claude Florimond de Mercy, 1666-1734, a soldier not an
   abbé; a 19th-c. bishop of Luçon). Given the volume is Spanish-affairs and the date falls in the Catalan
   Revolt / Franco-Spanish War period, a search for French agents to Catalonia in 1648 (Magí Sivillà i
   Magoles, an abbot acting for the Generalitat; Abel Servien; Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt) found no match
   either. This is a genuine identification gap, not a checked-and-clear negative -- the addressee's identity
   needs the image or the volume's own finding aid, not a general web search.
2. **Printed correspondence / calendars.** Not run: no correspondent securely identified to search by name.
   The instruction itself, addressed by the French crown to its own agent, would most plausibly appear (if
   printed) in a Recueil des instructions données aux ambassadeurs volume for Spain -- not checked this pass.
3. **Cryptiana.** Local snapshot grepped for "Mercy", "Espagnol 142": no hit.
4. **Cipherbrain.** No dedicated query run; the addressee's uncertain identity makes a targeted Cipherbrain
   search unproductive without first resolving who "l'abbé de Mercy" is.
5. **DECODE.** Aymeloglu's cached `catalogue/decode-catalog.csv` (10,107 rows) grepped for "mercy",
   "espagnol 142", "espagnol 143", "espagnol 144": zero hits for any. This repo's own local harvest also has
   no matching row.
6. **Solver repositories.** Fresh shallow clones of both repos grepped for "Mercy" and "Espagnol 142"/
   "cc347546" exactly. "Mercy" returns many hits in both repos (e.g. `herbault1626/`, `bethune/`, `sega1593/`,
   `windischgraetz1720/`, `matignon1586/`) but every one checked by context is either the common French word
   "merci"/"mercy" (clemency) inside unrelated letter transcriptions, or an unrelated named person (none an
   "abbé de Mercy" or this shelfmark). No hit for the shelfmark or ark in either repo.

## Verdict

**Open, stage 2 verified unsolved (conditional).** Not found in a search engine, Cryptiana, DECODE's cached
catalogue, or either solver repository, searched by shelfmark, ark and the addressee's name on 24 Sept 2026.
Conditional, and lower-confidence than most of this pass's rows: the addressee "abbé de Mercy" could not be
identified as a historical figure this pass (name variant, mistranscription, or an obscure agent are all
possible), which blocks the correspondent-specific legs of the sweep (printed correspondence, calendars). The
image or the volume's own finding-aid context (title, adjacent items) is needed before this row can be swept
further.
