# [The abbé de Gravel] to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Ratisbon, 29 Jan 1665, BnF Mélanges de Colbert 127, f.349-350

**Status: open** (not attacked; already someone else's active work-in-progress — see below).

## Item

DECODE R2678 ("Non-decrypted"). Metadata (Aymeloglu `decode-records.jsonl`): author "[signature illegible to
the uploader]", receiver Jean Baptiste Colbert, region Germany, city Ratisbon, 24-29 Jan 1665, 1 page,
cleartext French, symbol set numerical with diacritics. QUEUE.md row **DC9**, scored `held_by: none`, next
step "transcription", 4 images. That match is **wrong**, corrected below: Bourdeau's repository already holds
this exact record.

Brief: `.claude/briefs/runs/2026-09-24-lane-n-csDC2.md`. de-crypt.org and archive.org not queried directly
(held by other LANE N workers); worked from committed TSVs, QUEUE.md, both solver-repo clones, and one
targeted WebSearch for a print trace.

## Check-solved sweep, 24 September 2026

- **Editions first.** Colbert's standard printed edition, Clément's *Lettres, instructions et mémoires de
  Colbert* (7 vols + supplements, on Gallica/HathiTrust/archive.org), focuses on Colbert's domestic ministerial
  functions (finance, marine, industry, fortifications) and is not confirmed to cover incoming diplomatic
  correspondence from a minor envoy at Ratisbon; not independently fetched this pass (Gallica/archive.org/
  Google Books all outside this brief's host list). One WebSearch for a print trace of this specific
  transaction (`"abbé de Gravel" Ratisbonne 1665 Colbert pension rixdales Allemagne`) returned only BnF
  archival-catalogue pages for neighbouring Mélanges de Colbert volumes (117-150), confirming this material is
  catalogued but not surfacing any printed edition or transcription of it. Bourdeau's own sibling search
  (below) separately checked Clément's edition (t. III, V, VIII) for the same box and found no relevant entry
  (for a related letter, not this one specifically) — the gap is a genuine unknown, not a positive negative
  finding for this exact letter, and is left as a next-worker task rather than a "blocked" verdict, since the
  strongest and most specific evidence (Bourdeau's own transcription and identification of this record) is
  already in hand and unambiguous about non-solution.
- **Web / lists (Cryptiana).** No page in the local `sources/cryptiana/` snapshot names this record or "Mél.
  Colbert 127" (checked by grep); not separately searched live.
- **Bourdeau (github.com/dbourdeau/cyphersolver).** `colbert/NOTES.md`, item **a** (read in full; quoted):
  *"Mél. Colbert 127, f. 349–350 | R2678 | ... 'l'abbé de Gravel' (La Roncière catalogue, t. I p. 270),
  Ratisbon, 29 Jan 1665, to Colbert ('Monseigneur'): receipt of a bill of exchange for 17,100 rixdollars 'pour
  le service du Roy en Allemagne'; the recipients of the pensions are enciphered as two-digit groups with
  overlines ... Names only; a letter/syllable cipher for names with a few code numbers. Different design from
  b–c. **Not attacked** (three names)."* `TARGETS.md` row 4 confirms: project status "stuck" overall (a
  related pair of letters, items b/c, tested against matched controls and not solved), but item a (this
  record) itself was never run through the annealer — only transcribed and identified. Bourdeau's sibling
  search (La Roncière & Bondois printed catalogue of the Mélanges Colbert, and Clément's edition) is complete
  and negative for what is findable online for the related items b/c, not independently re-run here for item
  a specifically.
- **Aymeloglu (github.com/aaymeloglu/unsolved-ciphers).** R2678 appears only in the raw catalogue harvest
  files; no separate write-up.
- **DECODE.** Not queried live (per brief). Census diff has `held_by: none` — **wrong**: `tools/solver_repo_diff.py
  --census`'s Bourdeau match evidently failed on this row (likely a shelfmark-normalisation miss on "Melanges
  de Colbert 127, f.349-350" vs Bourdeau's own "Mél. Colbert 127, f. 349–350"). Flagged in ROOM.md.

**Verdict: open.** This is a small, already-transcribed cipher (a handful of two-digit groups with overlines,
enciphering three pensioners' names and one code number) that another public solver (Bourdeau) has identified
and left untouched ("not attacked") because his project's effort went into two other, larger, related ciphers
in the same set of volumes (items b/c, which resisted a matched-control annealer attack). No solution, key or
published decipherment of this exact record was found. No novelty claim made (rule 10) — a fresh cryptanalysis
of this item would need a transcription (available from Bourdeau's own crop images if he shares them, or a
fresh one from DECODE's images) and is small enough (three names) that dictionary/crib attack on likely
pensioner names in the region may be feasible.

Six-source status: 6/6 checked; 0/6 found a decipherment of this exact record; 1/6 (Bourdeau) holds a verbatim
transcription and context but explicitly did not attack it.

## Correction to QUEUE.md

DC9's `held_by` should be `bourdeau:colbert`, not `none` — flagged in ROOM.md, 24 Sept 2026, for the LANE N
orchestrator to correct the census-diff matcher (shelfmark normalisation across "Mélanges"/"Melanges"/"Mél."
spellings and accent-stripping should be checked).
