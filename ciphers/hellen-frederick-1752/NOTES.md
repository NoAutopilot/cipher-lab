QUEUE row: CS2-18 (`sources/solver-diffs/2026-09-24-cyphersolver-site.tsv`, catalogue items 214/223 at

## What it is

Eight intercepted despatch copies from W.B. von der Hellen, Prussian chargé at The Hague, to Frederick II,
held at KHA Prins Willem V inv. 196 and transcribed on DECODE as R1953 (4 Jan 1752), R1049 (7 Sept 1756), R1046
(15 Apr 1763, "related/supporting"), R1047 (29 Apr 1763), R1060 (6 May 1763), R1061 (13 May 1763), R1048
(20 May 1763) and R1045 (5 Jul 1763) — 6 of the 7 catalogue-numbered records are the 1763 cluster. All are
DECODE status "Non-decrypted" (`sources/decode/records-non-decrypted-2026-09-24.tsv`, ids 1953/1049/1061/1060/
1049/1046/1045 all present, none "Partially decrypted" or "Decrypted"; no hard filter applies here per LANE N2
addition (c)).

## Six-source search log (24 September 2026)

1. **Bourdeau, quoted verbatim** (`hellen1752.html`, posted 20 Sept, updated 24 Sept 2026 — same-day fresh):
   *"No key was recovered and no enciphered passage was decoded... An archive collection of deciphered letters
   offers a lead for 1752, but no matching decipherment has been retrieved."* His audit corrected transcription
   errors (stray question marks turned into definite digits, a duplicated three-line passage on R1953 image
   13448 wrongly deleted as a transcription artefact) but found no key. He names the same Fagel inv. 5206 lead
   this row is nominated on, and reports it as **not yet retrieved** as of his last update — this worker is the
   first to open the NA viewer for it (below).
2. **Standard printed edition — actually read.** *Politische Correspondenz Friedrichs des Großen*, vols. 9 and
   10 (Frederick's own outgoing letters, covering Jan 1752 onward), archive.org `politischecorres09fred` and
   `politischecorres10fred`, full-text searched (`be-api.us.archive.org/fts/v1/search?q=Hellen&identifier=...`)
   for "Hellen": **hits in vol. 9**, all headed "Au secrétaire von der Hellen à la Haye" — Frederick's own replies
   to Hellen, e.g. "Berlin, 8 janvier 1752", "Berlin, 22 janvier 1752", "Potsdam, 8 février 1752", "Potsdam,
   15 février 1752" (dates matching the window around R1953's 4 Jan 1752 report). **These are Frederick's
   outgoing side of the correspondence, not a decipherment of Hellen's incoming cipher reports, and no
   plaintext of the target ciphertexts is printed here** — letter absent. This corroborates, independently, what
   Bourdeau's page states in one sentence: "A search of the printed Politische Correspondenz found replies and
   contextual references, but no matching plaintext for these targets."
3. **DECODE** (`sources/decode/records-non-decrypted-2026-09-24.tsv`): all 8 records Non-decrypted, no key or
   attached decipherment document for any of them per the cached listing (no login used this pass).
4. **Aymeloglu** (fresh shallow clone, `unsolved-ciphers`, 24 Sept 2026): "Hellen"/"Fagel" appear only inside his
   raw DECODE catalogue scrape files (`catalogue/decode-records.jsonl`, `catalogue/decode-catalog.csv`), not in
   any of his 8 solved/attempted write-ups — not attempted there.
5. **Cryptiana / Tomokiyo** (`sources/cryptiana/web/dutch.htm`, decoded as Shift-JIS — the file is Japanese
   text, not mojibake): confirms the same episode Bourdeau cites via De Leeuw — in autumn 1751 the Dutch
   intercepted a letter to the newly arrived Prussian envoy "De Hellen" (デ・ヘレン), but the previous envoy
   D'Ammon's codebook had been updated in the meantime and England was asked to decipher it instead. No sentence
   in this page names a decipherment of the 1752–1763 letters specifically, and "Roell"/"Dedem" do not occur in
   it at all (relevant to CS2-21/-22 below).
6. **Web search**: nothing beyond Bourdeau's own page and the DECODE catalogue turned up.

## Archival lead: NA Fagel inv. 5206 (duplicate-collection check, Luzerne lesson)

Tested `https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/archief/1.10.29/invnr/5206` (1 request, 24 Sept 2026):
`availability: DIGITALIZED`, **185 page scans**, unittitle "Van Von Hellen ('Sieur H'), Pruisisch
zaakgelastigde bij de Republiek, 1752-1753". The item sits inside toegang 1.10.29's finding-aid hierarchy under
the range 5204–5208, titled "Afschriften van ontcijferde brieven van vreemde gezanten hier te lande en elders
aan hun regeringen, bestemd voor de griffier Hendrik Fagel de Oude" ("copies of **deciphered** letters of
foreign envoys here and elsewhere to their governments, for the griffier Hendrik Fagel de Oude") — a genuine
decipherment series, not a raw-cipher one. Fetched the first scan's thumbnail
(`service.archief.nl/api/file/v1/thumb/61afd335-64a5-4282-bfd4-3388e3a09cf2`, 1 request): the page is continuous
cursive **clear French prose**, not cipher digits — image-confirmed as a decipherment, not a re-copy of the
cipher.

**This does not resolve CS2-18 by itself.** Inv. 5206's own unittitle date range is **1752–1753 only**. Of the
8 target ciphertexts, that window covers just R1953 (4 Jan 1752); the 1756 letter (R1049) and the six 1763
letters (R1045–R1048, R1060, R1061) fall outside it and are not addressed by this item. Bourdeau's page also
already flags a structural reason not to expect Prussian decipherments for the later cluster: citing De Leeuw,
"no Prussian codes broken between April 1757 and October 1763." **Whether inv. 5206's 185 pages include the
specific 4 January 1752 report matching R1953 has not been checked page-by-page here** (out of this brief's
scope — check-solved does not transcribe or align); that is a recovery-lane task once fetched.

## Verdict

**`open -- Politische Correspondenz Friedrichs des Großen vols. 9-10 (archive.org politischecorres09fred,
politischecorres10fred) full-text searched for "Hellen", letter absent (only Frederick's own outgoing replies
printed); Bourdeau's hellen1752.html (updated 24 Sept 2026) read in full, no key or decipherment recovered.`**
No source claims a decipherment of any of the 8 target ciphertexts. **Recovery-lane flag**: NA Fagel inv. 5206
(copy-free, 185 scans, image-confirmed clear-text decipherment series, 1752–1753) is a ready-to-fetch source for
R1953 specifically (4 Jan 1752), not for the 1756/1763 letters, which need a different Fagel or KHA inventory
covering those years (not identified this pass).

Grade counts: H 0, C 0, S 0, M 0, I 0 (nothing read here; check-solved does not decode). Rule 10: no novelty
claim made; this is a search result, not a verifier's classification.
