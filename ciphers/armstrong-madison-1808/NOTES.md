# John Armstrong to James Madison, Paris, 20 February 1808 -- unique/private code + shorthand

QUEUE row: 27 (rank 30). CATALOG.md line 160 ("Open (a claimed solution is disputed)"). LANDSCAPE.md line 53
("The AFIO claimed solution adjudicated and rejected. Still unsolved."). POOLS.tsv line 599 (pool of 1).
Assigned by the parent 26 Sept 2026 (ROOM.md 06:34) after S. Tomokiyo (Cryptiana) named this his preferred
target for us, in reply to the owner's 24 Sept email (`outreach/tomokiyo-gramont-danzay.md`), recommending it
"via sibling-code vocabulary".

## What the cipher is

**Not the Armstrong-Madison office code.** Armstrong's routine correspondence with Madison (1804-1810) used
a single ~1600-element word/syllable code conventionally labelled by its group for "the", **THE=972**
(Weber, *United States Diplomatic Codes and Ciphers, 1775-1938*, pp.154, 188, cites ~40 letters in it among
DUSMF, NARA RG 59 microcopy M34 rolls 13-14). The 20 Feb 1808 letter is not in that code: Madison himself
wrote to Jefferson on 15 May 1808 (Founders 99-01-02-3082) that "The undecyphered letter from A. was
probably misaddressed to the Secretary of State. No such Cypher is in the office, and must be one concerted
with another correspondent" -- Angela Kreider (editor, Papers of James Madison, U.Va.) reads this as
referring to the 20 Feb letter, and her team confirms no other State Department code (Weber's own printed
codes included) matches it either. Bourdeau's `armstrong/NOTES.md` gives the quantitative version: his
merged THE=972 table (see below) decodes the *15 Feb 1808* Armstrong-to-Madison letter (Founders
99-01-02-2703, five days earlier, same code) at 72% (176 of 243 groups H/C-known, producing continuous
sense), but the *20 Feb* letter at only 25% (92 of 369 groups), and those hits render as noise, not sense --
"the 20 Feb code is a different code". It also carries "graphical symbols" resembling a shorthand mixed
with the numeral groups (35 short passages plus two full lines, `*`/`**`/`***` in `ciphertext.txt`); Tomokiyo
compared them to Taylor's 1786 shorthand (no match) and, per Norbert Biermann's bibliography lead (a German
1895 book with an 18th-century English-shorthand bibliography, pp.38-40), lists Weston, Mitchell, Gurney,
Byrom, Mavor and Macaulay as further candidates, none checked against the symbols as of the June 2026
update.

**Correction to QUEUE row 27's own cheap-test description.** The row reads "Place Krajcovic's crib from
Armstrong's 15 Feb 1808 letter to Jefferson against the opening groups in ... feb20_ciphertext.txt". Two
things in that sentence do not check out:
1. **"to Jefferson" is wrong.** Founders Online 99-01-02-2703 is headed "**To James Madison** from John
   Armstrong, Jr., 15 February 1808" (confirmed by direct fetch this pass, via Wayback). Every source this
   sweep read (Tomokiyo, Bourdeau, Founders itself) treats the 15 Feb letter as Armstrong-to-Madison, in the
   ordinary THE=972 code -- the same letter Bourdeau's own paired check (above) uses as the positive half of
   his negative result on the 20 Feb letter. There is no "Armstrong to Jefferson, 15 Feb 1808" letter found
   anywhere in this sweep.
2. **No "Krajcovic" connects to Armstrong anywhere reached.** Grepped fresh clones of both solver
   repositories, `sources/cryptiana/`, this repository's own QUEUE.md/STATUS.md/LANDSCAPE.md/CATALOG.md, and
   two WebSearch queries: the only "Krajcovic" this repository has on file is a solver credited on a wholly
   unrelated target, `UNSOLVED-SURVEY.md` line 113 ("Catokwacopa ads, Evening Standard", 1875, "Bosbach,
   Estes, Ernst, Krajcovic readings since 2018"). This reads as a scout-row mixup (a name from a different
   target's cheap-test note attached to this one), not a real, findable crib -- flagged, not corrected in
   QUEUE.md by this worker (out of this brief's file list; the parent should decide whether to fix the row).

Given both problems, the spec below (`specs/armstrong-madison-1808.json`) does not name "Krajcovic's crib"
as test 1; it describes what a crib-placement test against the 15 Feb 1808 letter can actually mean here
(the two letters share no code, so a crib test is about shared vocabulary/structure across Armstrong's own
letters generally, not a key transplant) and marks the named source unverifiable.

## Ciphertext (Bourdeau's transcription, CLAUDE.md rule 8)

Copied unmodified into `ciphertext.txt` from `cyphersolver/armstrong/feb20_ciphertext.txt` (commit
763a3b98ab1c, MIT code / CC BY 4.0 text), itself transcribed from the Founders Online Wayback copy of
99-01-02-2728 (Founders' own site is now CloudFront-challenged for scripts, confirmed this pass: a direct
curl fetch returns HTTP 202 with 0 bytes). **369 groups, 216 distinct, values 1 to 1900.** 35 short passages
plus 2 full lines are graphic symbols, not numeral groups (marked `*`/`**`/`***`); one group is illegible
(`<..>`). The opening word "The" is in clear. No independent second transcription against the NARA M34
roll 14 images (29-32) has been made by anyone found this sweep -- Bourdeau's own notes flag this as
unverified against the manuscript.

## Sibling codes named by Bourdeau or Tomokiyo

| Code | Correspondents | Size | Published how, by whom | Fits the 20 Feb letter? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **THE=972** (unlabelled WE number) | Armstrong <-> Madison, 1804-1810, all *other* known letters | ~1600 elements, blockwise alphabetical (many short A-Z runs, syllables restart the alphabet every few dozen groups) | **In part.** Tomokiyo's own partial table (227 entries, from the one known-plaintext letter of 4 May 1806, `code972_partial.json`) merged by Bourdeau with ~580 pencil decodes harvested from NARA M34 roll 13's marginal annotations (`pairs.txt`, `armstrong/NOTES.md`) into a 580-of-~1600-group table (H/C/M/I graded), published as `key972.js` in the repo (MIT) and rendered on `docs/armstrong.html` (CC BY 4.0 text) | **No** (Bourdeau's own paired-check negative, above: 72% on 15 Feb, 25%/noise on 20 Feb) |
| **WE027** | Robert R. Livingston (Armstrong's predecessor) <-> Madison | ~1700 elements, blockwise alphabetical | **Not published anywhere found.** Named only descriptively by Tomokiyo, cited to Weber 1979 pp.154, 188 (a print survey, not a transcription); no `.txt`/`.json` table for WE027 exists in Bourdeau's repo or Tomokiyo's site | Not tested (no table exists to test with) |
| **WE028 (THE=1385)** | James Monroe (sent to Paris to assist Livingston) <-> Madison | 1600 elements, blockwise alphabetical | **Published in full by Tomokiyo himself.** Fetched `WE028.txt` this pass (cryptiana.web.fc2.com/code/WE028.txt, one request): 1600 semicolon-separated `code;word` lines, 1 to 1600, no gaps found on a line-count check. Same office, same period, same code-construction convention (word/syllable groups, blockwise-alphabetical runs) as THE=972, but a different correspondent's own table -- not applied here | Not tested this pass |

No sibling code's own vocabulary has been checked, digit-for-digit, against the 20 Feb letter's 216 distinct
groups by this worker (per the brief: intake only, no cryptanalysis). Tomokiyo's suggestion ("a model might
read it if it learns the vocabulary of a sibling code") reads, after this sweep, as more plausibly about the
*construction convention* the three codes share (word-and-syllable groups, blockwise-alphabetical runs,
common-word homophones) than about any single sibling's *values* transferring directly -- THE=972's own
values are already shown not to fit.

## The AFIO claimed solution and its adjudication

**Claim.** The Association of Former Intelligence Officers announced, 27 May 2025 ("We Have a Winner in the
Armstrong-Madison Encrypted Letter Contest!", afio.com/member-news, fetched directly this pass), that
member Yaacov Apelbaum had decrypted the letter: a 56-entry code-to-word table and a 60-word "Decrypted
Text" ("The petitions of your seamen concerning their treatment have been examined ... we shall receive
satisfaction."), with a stated four-part "verification methodology" (internal consistency, cross-reference
with Armstrong's 1804/1806 letters, frequency analysis, stylistic reconstruction).

**Rejected, independently, twice:**
- Tomokiyo's article judged it unconvincing on inspection (Oct 2025, restated June 2026): partial coverage,
  forced fit.
- Bourdeau's adjudication (`armstrong/NOTES.md`, 16 Sept 2026, `adjudicate_feb20.py`) is the quantitative
  version: the key covers 133 of 369 groups (36%; 51 of 216 distinct), 5 of its 56 numbers never occur in the
  letter, 6 of the 60 published plaintext words have no code group backing them at all, and -- the decisive
  test -- **a key built by the same procedure (walk the plaintext, assign each word the next free group) on
  a *shuffled* copy of the ciphertext fits the claimed sentence and the letter as a whole *better* than the
  AFIO key does**: 500 such random keys average 70% in-span occurrence-consistency and 41% over the whole
  letter, against the AFIO key's own 59% and 30%. A key that fits random noise better than it fits the real
  text carries no information about the code. This is a matched-control negative already run and on file,
  not something this intake worker re-ran.

## The "prestigious publication project"

The June 2026 blog post's own wording: "the editorial team is still very interested in the content of the
letter. If it can be solved in the next year or two, they could probably include it in their next volume of
Madison Papers." This is the **Papers of James Madison** (University of Virginia, Founders Online's own
publisher; editor Angela Kreider, per `madison_armstrong.htm`'s "Historical Context" section) -- not named
more specifically than that in either Cryptiana post read this pass.

## What is still open, for a future solver (not run here, per this brief)

1. A crib/vocabulary test using Armstrong's *other* letters (15 Feb, 22 Feb, 4 May 1806, all in THE=972 and
   already transcribed by Bourdeau) for period/register/idiolect match against the 20 Feb letter's word
   lengths and repeats -- not a key transplant (THE=972 does not fit), a language-model-style vocabulary
   prior, matched against a shuffled control per CLAUDE.md rule 3.
2. WE028's full 1600-entry table, and a from-scratch structural comparison of its blockwise-alphabetical
   layout against the 20 Feb letter's own group-value distribution (whether the same block boundaries
   recur, even if the values differ) -- untested.
3. The shorthand passages (35 short + 2 full lines): Tomokiyo's shorthand-bibliography lead (Weston,
   Mitchell, Gurney, Byrom, Mavor, Macaulay, Taylor) is unchecked against the actual symbols.
4. A second, independent transcription against the NARA M34 roll 14 manuscript images (29-32) -- the
   Founders Online group list has never been checked against the original by anyone found this sweep.
5. Kreider's own list of candidate "other correspondents" for a private cipher: William Pinkney (Britain),
   James Monroe (Pinkney's predecessor), George W. Erving (Spain), Robert R. Livingston (Armstrong's
   brother-in-law and predecessor in Paris), or Armstrong's New York political circle -- none of their
   1808 correspondence has been located or checked against this code by anyone found this sweep.

    EXIT:0

## ARM-CODES corpus (26 Sept 2026)

Built `tools/data/uscodes-1800/` for the sibling-code vocabulary family (per Tomokiyo's suggestion): four
value->word TSVs (WE028 1600 entries; THE=972 in three renderings, 580/227/95 entries with Bourdeau's H/C/M/I
grades kept where published), Bourdeau's own decodes of Armstrong's other 1808 letters (his idiolect, same
months as the target), and a stats script comparing last-digit distribution, value-gap pattern, alphabetical
block structure and homophone counts across the tables, THE=972's real usage, and the target. Full detail and
sourcing in that directory's own README.md and HYPOTHESES.md's new "ARM-CODES corpus" section; no decoding of
the target and no family run this pass, per this job's brief -- both are queued next (ARM-A2, then family C).
Headline: no sibling table or usage instance reproduces the target's last-digit skew (digit-0/digit-1 at
25%/18% of tokens) or its 900-1099 value gap, so neither is inherited from a codebook already on file; all
four tables are built in short alphabetical blocks (~5-16 entries each), the same construction convention
across Livingston's, Monroe's and Armstrong's own codes. WE027 (Livingston<->Madison) and every other
WE-numbered code Tomokiyo names have no downloadable table anywhere found, only inline worked specimens; Weber
1979 itself is on Internet Archive but print-disabled-tier and unborrowable by this account, and has no
HathiTrust volume for its OCLC number either -- not chased further.

## ARM-EN18 (26 Sept 2026): era/register-matched judge corpus built and fold-checked

The spec's `judge` block used `LANG_CORPORA["en"]` (Sherlock Holmes 1892 + Moby-Dick 1851, both 19th-c.
fiction), already flagged by TOMO-REPLY's `corpus_caveat` as an era/register mismatch for this 1808 Paris
despatch (CLAUDE.md rule 3's pt18/es17c/EN-FOLDS lessons). Built `tools/data/en18/` -- six Internet Archive
full-text sources of 1794-1819 American diplomatic/official correspondence (Monroe Vols II/V, Gallatin Vol I,
Madison Vols VII/VIII, Jefferson Vol IX; two more Monroe volumes 503'd on IA and were dropped after one retry
each, per the good-citizen rule), 4,806,387 letters after `fold()`. Registered as `LANG_CORPORA["en18"]` in
`tools/judge_plaintext.py` (a shared-tool option, not a private copy, per Usage item 8), with an offline test
(`tools/tests/test_judge_plaintext_lang_en18.py`, a held-out Madison passage not in the corpus, passes; shuffled
and random-letter controls both fail).

Leave-one-file-out fold check at N=1000/1500 (about this target's own 369-code decode length, not the 200/500
`tools/data/en`'s own check used): blended false-negative rate **14.2%/15.1%**, per-fold spread **0.270/0.260**
-- roughly 4x lower and 2.5x tighter than the identical check run against `en` at the same N this pass
(58.6%/64.8% blended, 0.675/0.710 spread). Register-matching helped substantially here, the same direction as
pt18 vs pt17, but **the spread is still above the EN-FOLDS amendment's 0.05 gate** (Gallatin Vol I and Jefferson
Vol IX read as outliers against the more despatch-heavy Monroe/Madison volumes when held out) -- a FAIL/PASS
against `en18` is better-calibrated than against `en` but not a settled result. Full numbers in
`tools/data/en18/README.md`. `specs/armstrong-madison-1808.json`'s judge block updated: `language` -> `en18`,
`letters_min`/`letters_max` widened to 600/3000 (the previous 200/500 range cannot fit a 369-group decode),
`corpora_note` records the numbers above. No long-s OCR misreads found in any of the six sources (checked, not
corrected -- none needed). Requests: archive.org about 16 (six successful `_djvu.txt` fetches, two
advancedsearch.php calls, two 503s on `writingsjamesmo0{4,5}unkngoog` retried once each per the good-citizen
rule then dropped, one held-out test snippet via byte-range on a seventh, uncommitted volume). No other hosts.

## ARM-REC pass, 26 Sept 2026 (LANE ARM worker ARM-REC) -- is a key/decode/summary of the letter extant?

Full detail in `crib_sources.md`. Short version: **no decode and no later summary of the 20 Feb letter's
content found anywhere reached this pass.** The strongest evidence on file is still Kreider's own statement
(already quoted above, re-read this pass from `madison_armstrong.htm`): "we've found no evidence that it ever
was decoded, nor that Madison acknowledged receiving it." New this pass, consistent with that: the Library of
Congress's own hand-written finding-aid abstract of Armstrong's letters to Madison, 1804-1814
(`loc.gov/item/mss31021a016/`, 2 of 17 images read directly) jumps straight from 4 May 1805 to 30 Aug 1808 --
no Feb 1808 entry of any kind, suggesting nobody who compiled that finding aid had a readable text of it
either. web.archive.org was unreachable this pass (repeated connection resets, confirmed via the agent
proxy's own relay-failure log as a genuine host outage, not a proxy fault) -- Founders Online's own editorial
notes and its 21 Feb-31 Aug 1808 Armstrong letter index (this brief's step 1) could not be checked and are
still open for a successor. DECODE's cached listing (re-read, not re-fetched) and NARA's catalog API (blocked
without the missing key, matching the existing playbook note) add nothing new.

**Correction filed against this file's own "What is still open" wording above:** a genuine "John Armstrong to
Thomas Jefferson, 15 February 1808" letter *does* exist (Thomas Jefferson Papers, Library of Congress,
`loc.gov/item/mtjbib018243/`, not in the Madison Papers collection this file's earlier search covered) --
contra this file's own "There is no 'Armstrong to Jefferson, 15 Feb 1808' letter found anywhere in this
sweep." It is, however, entirely in clear (a short personal letter of recommendation for a messenger, plus a
note on Lafayette's Louisiana land grant and an enclosure on M. Skipwith), addressed to a different recipient
in a different register from the diplomatic 20 Feb letter to Madison, so it still does not supply "Krajcovic's
crib" (that name remains unconnected to anything found) or a usable key transplant -- at most one more
period/idiolect data point alongside the already-known 15 Feb and 22 Feb 1808 letters to Madison.

Kreider's four named candidate "other correspondents" (Pinkney, Monroe, Erving, Livingston): the James Monroe
Papers collection at LOC returned 0 hits for "Armstrong"; no direct Armstrong-Erving item found by name-pair
search; Livingston search timed out twice (loc.gov intermittently unresponsive this pass) and was not
completed; Pinkney not searched by name-pair (only the already-known wrong-direction Pinkney-to-Madison
letters are on file). None of the four produced a coded sibling letter to test as a pool.

Requests this pass: web.archive.org 1 success (CDX reachability ping) + 3 failed (connection reset, host
outage, stopped per good-citizen rule) -- Founders-dependent steps of this brief's job not completed. loc.gov
about 14 (2 timed out on complex queries after one retry each, per the good-citizen rule; rest succeeded).
catalog.archives.gov 2 (confirms existing "needs x-api-key" finding). DECODE 0 new fetches (cache re-read).
No logins, no credentials touched.

## ARM-A2 (26 Sept 2026): sibling-table direct-transfer sweep -- negative, both controls on file

`ciphers/armstrong-madison-1808/a2/transfer.py` (offline, seeded, no network) decoded the target's 369 numeral
groups under each of the four tables in `tools/data/uscodes-1800/` and scored the result with a word-bigram
model built from the en18 corpus, against two matched controls per CLAUDE.md rule 3: 200 tables made by
permuting each table's own plaintext column within alphabetical blocks of 20 consecutive values (destroys the
value->word pairing, keeps the value range and blockwise-alphabetical structure), and 200 shuffles of the
target's own token order decoded with the real table. No table transfers: all four FAIL
`tools/judge_plaintext.py`'s language check outright (WE028 -1.082, THE972_bourdeau -0.939,
THE972_tomokiyo_clean -0.883, THE972_tomokiyo_partial -1.108, all against real_p05 thresholds of roughly -0.80
to -0.90), and no table's percentile against either control is an extreme tail value once read alongside its
own coverage (WE028 highest coverage, 328/369 tokens, sits at the 70th/96th percentile of its two controls but
still FAILs the absolute language gate; the three THE=972 tables cover only 14-108 of 369 tokens, too few
adjacent-covered-pair bigrams (7-33) for a percentile to mean much). A round-trip positive control (re-encoding
Bourdeau's own known-plaintext decode of the 15 Feb 1808 letter under `THE972_bourdeau.tsv` and decoding it
back) recovers 87.3% of its words/syllable-fragments exactly, proving the pipeline is mechanically correct, but
still FAILs the same language judge at that length -- THE=972 publishes bare syllable fragments as entries
("ac", "ce", "mp", "t"), and dropping uncovered in-between words breaks the character-level 4-gram fluency the
judge scores, an artifact of the code family and the judge, not a pipeline defect (full explanation in
HYPOTHESES.md's ARM-A2 section, which also has the per-table table and the salad). No transfer is reported as a
reading (rule 10); the ladder's family B (vocabulary prior, not direct value transfer) and family E (recovery)
remain open. `specs/armstrong-madison-1808.json`'s `cheap_test_done.A2` records the same summary. No network
access this pass (offline job per brief); 0 requests to any host.

## ARM-REC2 pass, 26 Sept 2026 -- retried ARM-REC's step 1; web.archive.org still down

Full detail in `crib_sources.md`. **web.archive.org did not recover**: retested at 07:29-07:32 UTC (three
fetches, root page and a CDX query), all `Connection reset by peer`, confirmed via the agent proxy's own
relay-failure log as the same host-side outage ARM-REC found at 07:11, not a proxy fault -- `archive.org`
itself (non-Wayback) answers fine in the same window, so the outage is specific to the Wayback subdomain.
Founders Online direct (the metadata JSON dump) retested once, still the CloudFront empty-202 challenge, not
retried further. Founders' own editorial notes to 99-01-02-2728, and the full text of the 21 Feb-31 Aug 1808
Armstrong/Madison/Jefferson letters this brief's step 1 asks for, remain unfetched; this is now the second
consecutive worker to find the host down, so a parent check-in should confirm real recovery before a third
worker spends requests on it.

**Fallback that did produce results, using no Wayback/Founders fetch at all:**
1. **30 Aug 1808 postscript code and first groups** -- answered in full from Bourdeau's page already on disk
   (no host needed): **THE=972**, Armstrong's ordinary office code with Madison (not the 20 Feb letter's
   unknown code). First groups quoted exactly: "1394. 1116. 1273. 250. 1165. 1405." Full 49-group postscript
   decodes (48 of 49 determined): "Russel ought to be the consul: he is an American by birth, and is much
   better qualified than any other candidate. In a word, he is above men in general. Next to him in fitness is
   O'Mealy, but he is, like Warden, an Irishman[-re]." Founders prints the groups as Early Access document
   99-01-02-3466, undeciphered.
2. **Armstrong-to-Jefferson 15 Feb 1808 (`mtjbib018243`): does Founders print it, any part in cipher?** Founders
   Online does print it, as Jefferson Papers document **99-01-02-7420** (identified this pass, not previously on
   file) -- title and indexed paraphrase match ARM-REC's own direct manuscript read closely (the Talleyrand
   messenger, Admiral La Touche Tréville, Lafayette's Louisiana grant). **No part is in cipher** -- confirmed
   independently by ARM-REC's own primary-source read (entirely in clear), not by the Founders title match
   alone, which was not fetched and cannot itself be trusted for content (WebSearch's own synthesized summaries
   proved unreliable this pass -- one query restated the already-discredited AFIO "Decrypted Text" as if it were
   a real decode, which crib_sources.md flags explicitly).
3. A table of 13 further Founders document IDs (titles/dates only, located via WebSearch, none fetched) for
   Armstrong-Madison and Madison-Jefferson correspondence Feb-Sept 1808, as a fetch list for whichever
   successor next has a working Wayback route -- full table in crib_sources.md. New cross-reference found: the
   "undecyphered letter" note (99-01-02-3082, Madison collection) is cross-listed as **99-01-02-8003** in the
   Jefferson collection. Jefferson's own reply to that note is still not located; the nearest dated candidate
   (99-01-02-8006, Madison to Jefferson again the next day) is unconfirmed and not itself a reply from Jefferson.

## ARM-DESIGN (26 Sept 2026, LANE ARM worker ARM-DESIGN, Fable): family B design verdict

Plaintext-free statistics computed on the sibling tables' known layout, the four real THE=972 letters and 60
simulated 369-token en18 letters per design (contiguous one-part / two-part / WE028 blockwise / THE972 partial /
sequential-with-particle-block; decade designs H-DEC, H-HOM lazy and flat, gapped-insertion numbering), then on the
target; all numbers side by side in HYPOTHESES.md "ARM-DESIGN", scripts and tables in `design/`. Verdict: the letter
is a two-level numeric code -- a ~99-entry particle list at 1-99 (K~100 by a Zipf fit, top five values carry 14%
of tokens, flat digits) and above 100 a family book whose units digit is a fixed-meaning member slot (0 >> 1 >
4,6,7 >> 2,3,5,9, the same digits in every hundred-block): the digit concentration puts the target at percentile
100 against every contiguously numbered design and every real THE=972 letter, the digit order refutes lazy
homophone choice and fill-in-order insertions, and the decade/units dependence (z=2.76 against its own permutation
null) refutes homophones chosen independently of the word. One-part vs two-part vs blockwise is not decidable from
the ciphertext at this length (the statistics overlap by more than their shift), and the siblings are block-local
at best, so family C gets no alphabetical constraint. Above 100 the block reads as content words with near-full
coverage (168 distinct in 237 tokens; en18 content streams give 196, p05 170), so the book holds ~900-1800 forms,
not 180 roots with inflections (which would leave ~300 words per letter for the 37 shorthand passages). Family C's
unknown, score and matched control are written in `design/family_C_spec.md`. The single most valuable next access
step is the NARA M34 roll 14 image check of the units digits (open item 4 above): the whole verdict rests on
Bourdeau's transcription of the Founders group list, and a systematic misreading of 2/3/5/9 would collapse it to a
contiguous code. Requests this session: none (offline). Not done, per the brief: no decode to words, no family C
tool.
